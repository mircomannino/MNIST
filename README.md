# MNIST
Usage of the MNIST dataset with different python script and implementation of different type of approach

## Data
Download the [train_set.csv](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/mnist_train.csv) and [test_set.csv](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/mnist_test.csv)
To execute the scripts you have to download **mnist_train.csv** and **mnist_test.csv**  and put them in a folder called **data** in
each of the folder that you are using.
```
If you are using the MNIST-1_layer folder you should have the file in the following path:
/Your/home/path/MNIST-1_layer-Batch_mode/data/mnist_train.csv
/Your/home/path/MNIST-1_layer-Batch_mode/data/mnist_test.csv
```

## MNIST - 1 Layer - Batch mode
Contains the python scripts to train and make prediction of the MNIST dataset, with a single layer neural network

## MNIST - 1 Layer - Mini batch
